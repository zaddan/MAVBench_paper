\section{Benchmarking Suite}



Our benchmarking suite tests the performance of drones when executing a diverse set of tasks that are either commonly executed by drones today or that are being vigorously researched.

Our benchmarking suite is made of various workloads that are split into two categories: micro-benchmarks and macro-benchmarks. Micro-benchmarks test the capability of a drone to execute a single, very narrow task that may be used as a kernel in many other, larger applications. Macro-benchmarks test the capability of a drone to execute a complete mission, such as delivering a package or searching for and rescuing a person in need.

Our benchmarking suite records the speed with which a drone is able to complete a task, and the power it consumes in doing so, as well as certain measures that are specific to the workload being run.
