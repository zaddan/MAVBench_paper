\section{Analysis}

In this section we characterize our workloads and determine the components of a drone's subsystem that their performance is most affected by. Thus, we get an accurate picture of exactly what is being tested by each workload.

We see that workload X stresses the parallel processing capability of a drone's companion computer, while workload Y's performance is unaffected by such-and-such component, etc.
