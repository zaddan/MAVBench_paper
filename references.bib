In this chapter, we present the progress our research team has made on building an insect-scale aerial vehicle and zoom into the critical reliability issues associated with this system. We give a brief background on micro aerial vehicles (MAV) and an introductory overview on the insect-scale \{MAV\} prototype called RobeBee. Detailed implementation of RoboBee's electronic control system is presented and the reliability concerns and considerations associated with its design are discussed. This chapter focuses on the design context and motivation of customized system-on-chip for microrobotic application and provides an in-depth investigation of supply resilience in battery-powered microrobotic system using a prototype chip. Improved performance and reliability has been confirmed in both simulation and experiment after applying codesign strategy between supply regulation and clock generation. We conclude with our vision on the future of \{MAV\} from a reliability perspective. "
